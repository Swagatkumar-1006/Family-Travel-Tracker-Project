# Family-Travel-Tracker-Project

This Node.js web application uses Express with PostgreSQL to track countries visited by users. It connects to a database with tables for users, countries, and visited countries. The app allows users to switch profiles or create new ones with custom colors. Users can view their visited countries and add new ones by submitting country names, which are matched against the database. The server dynamically renders pages using EJS templates. Key functionalities include user management, adding visited countries, and displaying personalized data. It runs on port 3000 and uses middleware for parsing form data and serving static files.
